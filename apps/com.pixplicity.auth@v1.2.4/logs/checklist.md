# Setup

> **Note:** Version 1.2.4 of the Pixplicity Authenticator app is included here
>           because the developer implemented some of our recommendations, so we
>           allow people to verify/reproduce those updates.

- [ ] Enable recording of plaintext network traffic generated by the device
  - Various techniques and tools can be used to record network traffic.
    Instructions for how to use open source tools to record betwork traffic on
    Pixel phones can be found [here](/capture-traffic/README.md).
- [ ] Make sure the phone has Internet access (e.g. WiFi is connected)
- [ ] Download `com.pixplicity.auth@v1.2.4` from from APKPure
      [here](https://apkpure.com/authenticator/com.pixplicity.auth/versions)
- [ ] Optionally, start screen recording with scrcpy:
```
$> scrcpy \
    --stay-awake \
    --bit-rate 4M \
    --max-fps 20 \
    --record android-screen.mp4
```
