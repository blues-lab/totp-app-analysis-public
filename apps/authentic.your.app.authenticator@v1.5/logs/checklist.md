# Setup

- [ ] Enable recording of plaintext network traffic generated by the device
  - Various techniques and tools can be used to record network traffic.
    Instructions for how to use open source tools to record betwork traffic on
    Pixel phones can be found [here](/capture-traffic/README.md).
- [ ] Make sure the phone has Internet access (e.g. WiFi is connected)
- [ ] Download `authentic.your.app.authenticator@v1.5` from APKPure
      [here](https://m.apkpure.com/two-factor-authenticator-app/authentic.your.app.authenticator/versions)
- [ ] Optionally, start screen recording with scrcpy:
```
$> scrcpy \
    --stay-awake \
    --bit-rate 4M \
    --max-fps 20 \
    --record android-screen.mp4
```
- [ ] Install the downloaded APK file(s): `$> adb install-multiple *.apk`

- [ ] Restore accounts
    - [ ] Select the backup (it seems like its from local storage)
    - [ ] Enter an incorrect passphrase: `thisismorethanten`. Recieve error
          message: "Oops, the imported file does not seem to be a valid backup
          or your password was incorrect"
    - [ ] Enter correct passphrase
    - [ ] Note only the first account got backed up, so it is a _manual_ backup
          that is taking place, not automatic.
