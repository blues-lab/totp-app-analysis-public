# USENIX'23 Artifact Appendix: Security and Privacy Failures in Popular 2FA Apps

This repository contains the supplemental material and artifacts discussed in
the paper titled `Security and Privacy Failures in Popular 2FA Apps`, which has
been accepted to [USENIX Security
2023](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23).

We strove to make our work fully verifiable and reproducible. To that end, the
artifacts and related instructions in this repo are intended to allow
researchers to verify and fully reproduce the findings presented in the paper.

The artifacts available include:

- [Search Terms](search_terms.txt): The list of search terms that we used to
  identify as many TOTP apps in the Google Play Store as possible (see Section
  4.1 - App Selection).

- **App Checklists**: For each app, the customized checklist that enumerates
  exactly which actions to take within the app and which data to enter while
  recording the network traffic (see Section 4.2.1 - Exploring the App).

- **Decryption Scripts**: For each app that supports encrypted TOTP backups, the
  golang script that implements the decryption process (see Section 4.2.3 -
  Performing Cryptanalysis).

Along with the instructions in this README, the app checklists and decryption
scripts allow researchers to reproduce the findings reported Tables 1, 2, and 3
in the paper:

- **Table 1**: Overview of the backup mechanisms supported in each app.
- **Table 2**: Overview of the backup mechanisms that automatically sync data to the cloud.
- **Table 3**: Cryptographic details of app backup mechanisms.

# Setup

Follow the [instructions here](capture-traffic/README.md) to setup your Android
phone and laptop to record the plaintext traffic generated by the TOTP apps
running on the phone.
